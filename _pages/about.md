I am a scientist at Qatar Computing Research Institute. My research interest encompasses multilingual, multimodal, and multiview representation learning.

I specialize in designing Conversational AI models, primarily addressing complex challenges such as multispeaker interactions, nuanced multilingual and dialect variations, and code-switching, among various other intricate conversational dynamics.

I am currently leading (PI) the [QVoice]([https://link-url-here.org](http://qvoice.qcri.org)) project, which empowers speakers—both native and non-native, children, and adults alike—to learn spoken Arabic, leveraging large multimodal AI models.

I have received numerous awards and grants, including the NVIDIA Academic Hardware Grant for my research in Simulating human language learning capabilities using DNN-based language models, a study that was also conducted as a part of the TRAILs project, funded by PRIN MIUR. As a key contributor to the EU-funded projects SENSEI and PortDial, I developed conversational models adept at understanding human conversation, facilitating automatic summarization and mental health screening.

I authored over 60 peer-reviewed publications in top-tier conferences and journals and played an active role in the research community by organizing shared tasks, challenges, and workshops, as well as serving on the committees of top-tier conferences and special interest groups.

I co-founded the Bangla Language Processing ([BNLP]([http://banglanlp.org])) Community and [MyVoice]([http://myvoice.arabicspeech.org]), a crowdsourced platform, designed to bridge the gaps between standard and dialectal Arabic resources. I am also maintaining the [ArabicSpeech]([http://arabicspeech.org]) Portal.
