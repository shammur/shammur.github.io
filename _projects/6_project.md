<!-- ## Updates -->

<!-- 🗓️ **July 2025**   -->
<!-- We are excited to share that the NAVIA project has received a **grant of 200,000 USD** -->

## Overview

**NAVIA** aims to pioneer a holistic framework for advancing early screening and intervention for Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) by integrating **multimodal AI technologies**, with a strong emphasis on **ethical** and **inclusive** practices.

---

## Objectives

- **Multimodal Detector:** Develop AI models to detect early behavioral and speech-related indicators of ASD.
- **Pre-Screening Support:** Generate comprehensive pre-diagnostic reports to assist clinicians in early-stage screening.
- **Multimodal Dataset:** Build a richly annotated dataset capturing speech and behavioral cues associated with ASD.
<!-- - **Cultural Sensitivity & Explainability:** Ensure models are transparent, interpretable, and sensitive to cultural and linguistic diversity. -->

---
## Intervention Platform

NAVIA will also deliver an **AI-powered therapy support platform** designed for clinicians and caregivers. This system will generate **personalized speech and language therapy exercises** tailored to each child’s unique profile, addressing:

- Expressive and receptive language delays
- Prosodic anomalies (e.g., pitch, rhythm, stress)
- Behavioral and communicative needs


<!-- Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental condition characterized by challenges in communication, social interaction, and repetitive behaviors. In Qatar, approximately 1 in every 87 children is diagnosed with autism, with a reported prevalence of 1.14% between 2015 and 2018. Although there is no cure for autism, early interventions—such as speech, behavioural, and occupational therapy—significantly improve outcomes, underscoring the importance of technology-driven support.  -->
<!-- The NAVIA project aims to pioneer a holistic framework for advancing early screening and intervention for ASD by integrating multimodal AI technologies, with a strong emphasis on ethical and inclusive practices.  -->

<!-- Its core objective is to develop AI models capable of detecting early indicators of autism and generating comprehensive pre-diagnostic reports to support clinical assessments. A key component of the project is the creation of a novel, richly annotated dataset capturing speech and behavioral cues associated with ASD. These multimodal signals will be analyzed to identify salient markers that will drive the development of accurate, culturally sensitive, and explainable AI models.  -->

<!-- Building on the screening insights, NAVIA will develop an AI-powered platform to support the clinicians and caregivers in generating personalized speech and language therapy exercises, tailored to each child’s unique communication profile and challenges — such as expressive/receptive language delays, prosodic anomalies and behavioral needs among others. -->
